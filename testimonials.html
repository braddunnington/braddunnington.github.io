              <p><i>“Brad and I were introduced in 2007 by a mutual CEO friend in Columbus who had worked with Brad for
                  the previous several years.&nbsp; My business, Air Force One, was experiencing the kind of operational
                  challenges that frustrate businesses trying to grow to the next level. Brad and I did an in depth
                  review of our business and he helped illustrate and navigate several important changes in how were
                  allocating and organizing resources. In our particular case, we were struggling between centralization
                  and decentralization. The first critical unlock for us, was the recognition that our business should
                  be decentralized, with most of the governance and pricing decisions happening close to the
                  customer.&nbsp; Since 2008 our business has grown 43% and I believe it is the kind of growth that is
                  sustainable because of the structure we have built to support it.&nbsp; After our initial 6 months of
                  meeting on a weekly basis, we throttled back to a monthly touch base, which we still do. Additionally,
                  Brad helps to facilitate our leadership meetings from time to time. He is humble, smart and passionate
                  about helping businesses and their associates be successful. I feel fortunate to have him as a
                  consultant to myself and our team.”&nbsp;</i></p>
              <p><b>Greg Guy</b></p>
              <p><b>CEO at Air Force One</b></p>
              <p><b><br></b></p>
              <p><i>“I value Brad’s breadth and depth of experience. His background in manufacturing, retail, finance,
                  and internet companies allows him to provide advice on a wide variety of management and business model
                  opportunities and challenges. Brad is an excellent listener which contributes to his ability to
                  provide insights with clarity and precision.&quot;</i></p>

              <p>&nbsp;<br></p>
              <p><i>“Brad is a great sounding board for me and has helped me to think thru different opportunities in
                  the work that we are doing at White Castle. In addition to being a trusted advisor, I have used Brad
                  for various facilitation engagements with my senior team - which allowed me to get more transparency
                  and feedback from my team.”</i></p>
              <p><b>Lisa Ingram </b><br><b>President and CEO at White Castle</b><br></p>
              <p>&nbsp;<br></p>
              <p><i>“Brad has continuously advised my high-growth, high-energy company and management team on how to
                  reach our full potential by helping us create the necessary infrastructure and tool sets. Brad helps
                  us make sure that the process of business doesn't ever get in the way of creating business. His
                  coaching expertise helps turn smart young people into effective and driven managers. And, as an added
                  bonus, Brad is a technology junkie, so I can always count on him to be up to speed on the latest and
                  greatest.</i><br><i>Last but not least, he is a super nice guy and a true pleasure to work
                  with.”&nbsp;</i></p>
              <p><b>Lisa Stein</b><br><b>Founder / CEO at Revolutions, Inc; SpinLife.com</b></p>
              <p>&nbsp;<br><i>“I have known Brad Dunnington for several years and have recently asked him to serve in an
                  advisory capacity for Syrus, Ltd. I have found the time and resources that our company has spent on
                  forming the relationship with Brad to be an excellent investment. Brad has not only a diverse and
                  relevant background in the technology industry, he also has the unique ability to capture and
                  articulate the business opportunities and challenges that we should consider, and to help us formulate
                  a strategy for exploiting those opportunities.</i><i>&nbsp; I have often commented that there are many
                  people who have an in depth knowlege of technology, but that Brad is one of the few I have met who
                  combine that with an equally deep knowledge and ability to advise on the 'business' of technology.
                  There have been many key tactical and strategic decisions that I have made only after an in depth
                  conversation and joint analysis of the subject with Brad.&nbsp; I feel confident recommending Brad
                  Dunnington for any position in which he is asked to advise on strategy or similarly important tactical
                  initiatives.”&nbsp;</i></p>
              <p><b>Jim Karam</b><br><b>President at Syrus, Ltd.</b></p>
              <p><b><br></b><i>“I first met Brad Dunnington a few years ago when he was a member of the local
                  TechColumbus COO Forum. I found Brad's broad knowledge and insight into business and finance
                  exceptional. He was consistently able to offer helpful input into issues and concerns raised by the
                  forum's business executives. Because I was able to see firsthand Brad's approach to business, I asked
                  Brad to join LSP Technologies' Advisory Board. I was thrilled that he accepted my request and Brad now
                  serves on our Board. Although he has only been a member of the Advisory Board for less than a year,
                  his contributions have already saved the company money and helped set us on a path of rapid
                  growth.&nbsp; I can highly recommend Brad Dunnington for any top level consulting on business and
                  finance, or to serve on your Board.&nbsp; Brad is top notch.”</i><br><b>Jeff Dulaney<br>President
                  &amp; CEO at LSP Technologies, Inc.</b></p>
              <p><b><br></b><i>“Brad has been on the Board of idegy, inc. for approximately 5 years. During this time,
                  we have also asked Brad to consult for us on initiatives ranging from Strategic &amp; Business
                  Planning, Performance Management, Compensation Systems Design, Sales Management and Technology. These
                  have all been very successful engagements. He is a trusted advisor and a valuable board member, as
                  well as a great coach to me and our whole management group. I enthusiastically recommend Brad's work
                  to others!”</i><br><b>Matthew Grossman | idegy<br>Founder &amp; CEO of idegy, inc.</b></p>
              <p><b><br></b><i>“Brad is a highly competent leader and business executive. His innate ability to rally
                  and motivate a team to accomplish great things sets Brad apart from his peer group. Combined with his
                  keen focus on delivering substantive, measurable results, he is a tremendous asset to any
                  organization.”</i><br><b>Dave Brumback <br> Partner at Columbus Consulting International</b></p>
              <p><b><br></b></p>
              <p><i>“<i>“Brad and his organization has been amazing to work with.&nbsp; He is a true partner, always
                    available and willing to do what it takes to deliver a seamless solution and a great experience both
                    for his customers and for their ultimate customers.&nbsp; His vision, patience and consistency have
                    been instrumental in helping us to achieve a capability today that we thought would still be months,
                    if not years away.&nbsp; Brad has a rare talent for taking strategy all the way through to
                    execution.</i>”</i><br><b>Matthew Dunlap<br>Chief Operating Officer, Charles Penzone, Inc.</b><br>

              <p><b><br></b></p>
              <p><i>“Brad has worked with Transmet as an Board Advisor for several years. He has helped guide us through
                  increasing our sales, improving our margins and focusing us on the best markets to pursue. He has also
                  helped Transmet work through shareholder changes and the 2008 recession.&nbsp; I would recommend Brad
                  to companies similar to Transmet. He is a valuable resource.”</i><b><br><b>P. Doug Shull<br>Owner

              <p><b><br></b></p>
              <p><i>“I met Brad in mid-2009 when we engaged an equity group he was working with.&nbsp; In 2010 he took
                  over the role of CEO and for more than three years he directed our business and the social media
                  expansion.&nbsp; Brad has a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas from social media, technology,
                  budgeting and executive coaching.&nbsp; His reading list is extensive and I think I am a better
                  executive after working for him for three plus years.&quot;</i><br><b>Liz Plotnick-Snay<br>Cheif
